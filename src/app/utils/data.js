Utilizing Python, I processed image data, compared predicted labels against actual labels, and calculated performance metrics to determine the best architecture for classifying images as either 'dog' or 'not dog' and accurately identifying dog breeds. While AlexNet achieved the same level of accuracy for dog and non-dog images, the number of breeds classified correctly was only 80%, compared to the VGG and ResNet 93.33% and 90% respectively. The analysis revealed that VGG achieved the highest overall performance, correctly identifying all dog and non-dog images and also achieving the highest breed classification accuracy, offering a practical understanding of CNN architecture performance and Python's role in image data analysis.",

A key feature is a sanity check, displaying the original image alongside a bar chart of the top predicted flower species with their probabilities, promoting interpretability. Through this project, I gained practical experience with PyTorch for model building, training, and optimization, including harnessing CUDA for accelerated computation. I mastered image preprocessing techniques using Torchvision and PIL, and proficiently handled data with NumPy. Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience with transfer learning using pre-trained models, model persistence through saving and loading, and data visualization using Matplotlib. The project solidified my understanding of the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model deployment, and strengthened my grasp of fundamental deep learning concepts.",

I handled challenges such as imbalanced classes, high dimensionality, missing values and noisy features. My preprocessing included scaling, feature selection and correlation removal, while model training applied SMOTE and class weighting to address imbalance. I evaluated the models using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, with XGBoost emerging as the best-performing model based on a combined score. I noted limitations like minority class prediction challenges, potential overfitting, and reliance on a single train-test split. I can make predictions by loading the trained model and preprocessing artifacts, generating PASS/FAIL results for new input data.",
